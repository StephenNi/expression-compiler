Basic Interpreter/Compiler for Arithmetic Expressions

Obligatory list of features (aka blurb):

- accepts (decimal) integer expressions containing the
  (binary) operators "+", "-", "*", and "/" with their
  "usual" semantics

- can interpret expressions directly, using an implicit
  stack

- can compile expressions to stack-based MIPS assembly
  code suitable for SPIM
