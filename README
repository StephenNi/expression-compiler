Basic Interpreter/Compiler for Arithmetic Expressions
The C Edition

Copyright (c) 2007-2013 by Peter H. Froehlich <phf@acm.org>.
All rights reserved.

Obligatory list of features (aka blurb):

- accepts (decimal) integer expressions containing the
  (binary) operators "+", "-", "*", and "/" with their
  "usual" semantics

- can interpret expressions directly, using an implicit
  stack

- can compile expressions to stack-based MIPS assembly
  code suitable for SPIM

Nothing more to say I guess? I use this code as part of a
tutorial on compilers for freshmen and sophomores. It's
also destined for chapter zero of my book on compilers,
if it ever sees the light of day that is... :-)

Enjoy,
Peter

PS: This C edition has fewer features than the original
Python code. Sorry. In fact, I am not even sure *why* I
re-wrote things in C in the first place? In any case, I
hope you enjoy reading through the mess that it is. :-)
