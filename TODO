- our vectors.h abstraction uses malloc/free, but it seems we could
  do better using mmap() and friends, see this article for example:
  http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/virtual_memory_arrays.html
  I don't want to spend time implementing that now, but keeping it
  in mind may be good... :-)

- made the mistake of adding the cute clp2() stuff to strings instead
  of vectors where it should go eventually; actually, why? seems that
  it's only needed for strings where we can start with any number of
  characters... unless we want all vectors to always have clp2() cap?

- instead of hardcoding SPIM stuff, we should do some fake OO to allow
  for multiple backends at runtime (maybe similar to the Python design)

- I should really write proper unit tests, either using asserts or some
  simple unit testing framework for C
